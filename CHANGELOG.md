  Thanks to @jlopez77 and @githubDante. See [GH issue #44](https://github.com/jmccrohan/pysolarmanv5/issues/44)

## [v3.0.0] - 2023-05-21

### Fixed

- MAJOR VERSION BUMP - v3.0.0

  v2.5.0 inadvertently introduced a breaking change and has been withdrawn.
  
  The breakage was introduced by [GH PR #33](https://github.com/jmccrohan/pysolarmanv5/pull/33) 
  which moves the PySolarmanV5 socket communications to a worker thread. While 
  this is a major improvement over the previous method, it requires that the
  disconnect() method is called to close the socket. 

  Prior to this, the socket was implicitly closed when the PySolarmanV5 object
  was deferenced. Many dependent applications re-instantiate a new object for
  each poll. These applications will need to either remain on v2.4.0, or
  upgrade to v3.0.0 and ensure disconnect() is called to close the connection
  cleanly.

  Many thanks to @connesha for highlighting this breaking change in [GH issue #39](https://github.com/jmccrohan/pysolarmanv5/issues/39)
- Restore Windows compatibility which was broken in v2.5.0 [GH PR#38](https://github.com/jmccrohan/pysolarmanv5/pull/38)
